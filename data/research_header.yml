  Plant ecophysiology offers an exciting chance to understand how plants function and how they cope with a changing environment. We use cutting-edge tools to explore the mechanisms behind a plant's tolerance to environmental stress, like drought. This knowledge is critical for predicting how plant communities will adapt and survive in the face of global change. Explore the links below to explore our main research topics.
